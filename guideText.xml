In the case of steps immediately
outside an external door of a building (i.e.
part of the building):\n
(a) where there are three steps or less,
only the recommendations in Table 1
and par. 1.1.4 apply;\n and\n
(b) where there are more than three steps,
all the provisions of this sub-section
apply.\n

    <guide name="k1.1.4">
     In any stairs -
(a) all of the steps should be of appropriate
dimensions and be of suitable
construction,
(b) all steps should have the same rise,
(c) all parallel steps should have the same
going,
(d) all tapered steps should have the same
going.
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.6">
    he varying tread width of a tapered
step can cause people to misjudge distances
and can lead to falls. For this reason, the use
of tapered steps should be avoided. If it is
necessary to use them, they should
preferably be situated at the bottom of the
stairs.
Public stairs should not contain tapered
steps.
Where consecutive treads are used, a
uniform going should be maintained. For
tapered treads, the going should conform
with par. 1.1.4 when measured as follows:
(a) if the flight is narrower than 1000 mm,
measured in the middle, and
(b) if the flight is 1000 mm or wider,
measured 270 mm from each side.
In addition, the going at the narrow end
should be a minimum of 75 mm (see Diagram
2)
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.7">
    Steps should have level treads.
Steps may have open risers but in such
cases the nosing of any tread should overlap,
on plan, the back edge of the tread next
below it by at least 16 mm (see Diagram 1).
For steps suitable for ambulant disabled
people refer to Technical guidance Document
M - Access and Use.
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.8">
    A stairway with open risers should be
constructed so that a 100 mm diameter
sphere cannot pass through the opening
between adjacent treads, unless the stairway
is unlikely to be used by children under five
years old.
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.9">
    Headroom over the whole width of
any stairs, measured as shown in Diagram 3,
should generally be not less than 2 m. In the
conversion of a loft where space is limited,
headroom measured at the centre of the
stairs should be not less than 1.9 m but may
reduce to not less than 1.8 m at the side of
the stairs if there is a minor projection.
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.10">
    Private stairs should have a clear
width of not less than 800 mm however; in
certain circumstances they may need to be
wider (See Technical Guidance Document M
- Access and Use, Section 3.3.2.2).
In the case of semi-public and public
stairways, designers should bear in mind the
requirements for stairs which:
(a) form part of a means of escape,
reference should be made to Technical
Guidance Document B - Fire Safety;
(b) provide access suitable for ambulant
disabled people, reference should be
made to Technical Guidance Document
M - Access and Use.
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.11">
    There should not be more than
sixteen risers in any one flight. A flight
containing one or two risers in private stairs
should be situated at the bottom of the stairs.

    n places of assembly to which large
numbers of people have resort, there should
be no more than two consecutive flights each
having a maximum of twelve risers, without a
change in direction of at least 30Â° between
flights (see Diagram 4).
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.13">
    A level landing should be provided at
the top and bottom of every flight except that
a landing may not be necessary between a
flight and a door if the total rise of the flight is
not more than 600 mm and the door slides or
opens away from the steps. The landing may
include part of a floor. The width and going
of the landing should be at least as great as
the smallest width of the flight.
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.14">
    Landings should be clear of
permanent obstruction. A door opening on to
a landing should be so positioned that there
will be a clear space of at least the full width
of the flight between the door swing and the
flight. In the case of private stairs, the landing
at the bottom of a flight may be reduced in
length provided a clear space of at least
400mm is maintained between the flight and
the door swing (see Diagram 5 for examples).

    Spiral stairs with goings less than
recommended in Table 2 of BS 5395 Part 2:
1984 and alternating tread stairs would not
normally be regarded as acceptable.
However, they may be considered in the
conversion of a loft where space is limited i.e.
where there is not enough space to
accommodate stairs satisfying par. 1.1.1 to
1.1.14 above and the stairs serves only
accommodation which will be used
infrequently and, where the accommodation
includes only one habitable room.
Alternating tread stairs should be in straight
flights, have handrails on both sides and the
treads should have slip resistant surfaces.
The goings and rises for the wider parts of
the steps should comply with par. 1.1.4
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.16">
    A fixed ladder should have fixed
handrails on both sides. It should not be
used as the primary access to a habitable
room
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.17">
    Stairs should have a handrail on at
least one side if it is 1000 mm wide or less. It
should have a handrail on both sides if it is
wider. The top surface of the handrail should
be between 900 mm and 1000 mm measured
vertically above the pitch line, and between
900 mm and 1100 mm above the landing,
Handrails should give firm support. A
handrail may form the top of the guarding if
the height is suitable (refer to Diagram 6).
The handrail should be so constructed and
fitted as to be capable of being readily
gripped by hand and safely used. Handrails
may not be necessary beside the two bottom
steps of private stairs.
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.18">
    Stairs should be guarded at the sides
(see Diagram 6), except where the total rise
is no more than 600 mm, in which case
guarding may not be essential. Suitable
guarding would include a wall, screen
(including glazing), railing or balustrade.
    </guide>
    <guide name="k1.1.19">
    Guarding should be designed and
built in such a way that it does not present
unacceptable risks of accidents in service.
Where guarding contains glazing, it should be
safety glazing in accordance with the
recommendations of BS 6262-4: 2005. In
buildings which are likely to be used by
children under five years old, guarding should
be so constructed that a 100 mm diameter
sphere cannot pass through any openings in
the guarding. Guarding should not be readily
climbable and should be designed in such a
way as to discourage young children from
climbing it. Features in the guarding that
might provide a foothold should be avoided
e.g. horizontal rails.
Where a cut string is used, the triangular
space formed by tread and riser is allowable,
provided the bottom edge of the guarding is
not more than 50 mm above the nosing line.
The triangular space formed by the tread and
riser is not allowable to stairs in dwellings and
common stairs in blocks of flats.

    A ramp should be so constructed that
the slope does not exceed 1:20, except in the
case of an individual flight the length of which
is not greater than 10 m, when the slope may
be greater. Under no circumstances should
the slope exceed 1:12.

should have a handrail on at least one side. It
should have a handrail on both sides if it is
wider. Handrails should be at a height of
between 900 mm and 1000 mm, measured
vertically, and give firm support. A handrail
may form the top of a guarding if the height is
suitable. The handrail should be so
constructed and fitted as to be capable of

    A landing should be provided at the
top and bottom of every ramp. Landings
should be level, except where they are
formed by the ground, in which case they
may slope up to 1:50 provided that the
ground is suitably paved. A landing may
include part of a floor. The width and length
of the landing should be at least as great as
the smallest width of the ramp and doors
should open away from landings. However, a
door swing may encroach on landing space
at the bottom of the ramp in a dwelling as
described in par. 1.1.14.

Guarding should also be provided to the
sides of raised floors of vehicle parks in
buildings, ramps used for vehicle access,
sunken areas connected to buildings and any
similar area where it is necessary for the
safety of persons in or about a building.
Guarding may not be essential where the
total difference in levels is 600 mm or less.
Guarding need not be provided to places
such as a loading bay or a stage where it
would be incompatible with normal use.

    In dwellings where a window has an
opening section through which a person may
fall, (having particular regard to children
under five years old), and is more than 1400
mm above external ground level, suitable
safety restrictors should be provided (see
Diagram 9).
Safety restrictors should restrain the window
sufficiently to prevent such falls. Restrictors
can be either an integral part of the window
operating gear or separate items of hardware
which can be fitted to a window at the time of
manufacture or at installation. Restrictors
should operate so that they limit the initial
movement of an opening section to not more
than 100 mm.
Note: Lockable handles or restrictors, which
can only be released by removable keys or
other tools, should not be fitted to window
opening sections required for escape
purposes (see TGD B Fire Safety).
